# dominant_no
 find a dominant in a sequence of integer numbers (represented as a table), e.g.dominant([1, 2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 1]) is equal to 1. If there are more numbers with the same frequency the first of them (in the table) should be reported as the result, e.g.dominant([1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]) is equal to 2.
